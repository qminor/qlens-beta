# The correct lens model for the simulated data used here is as follows:
# alpha (b=5, s=0, q=0.7, theta=90, center=(0.9,0.3)
# external shear (gamma=0.1, theta=40 degrees)
# Source point: (0.5, 0.7)
#
# In this script we show how to infer these parameters by fitting a lens model
# to the simulated data using the downhill simplex method with simulated annealing.

auto_save_bestfit off   # if turned on, automatically saves the best-fit model after running the fit (turned off by default)

sci_notation off        # This is just up to your personal preference

# Simulated annealing increases your odds of success even if your initial guess is not a very good fit; however, the
#    initial guess can still make a difference, and you may need to play around with it before doing the fit.
# Here are some tips for deciding your initial guess for the lens parameters:
# Use the scale of the images to guess the Einstein radius.
# Always fix alpha=1 and s=0 (singular isothermal ellipsoid model). These parameters usually cannot be
#    constrained well unless we have time delays or multiple source points.
# The center of the lens can often be guessed at by averaging the image positions (or using the center of the
#    lens galaxy in the image if it is visible).
# It may only be possible to constrain both the external shear and axis ratio q if image fluxes or time delays
#    can be used in addition to the image positions. If you do model the external shear, guess a small
#    but nonzero value for both gamma and the angle, as we do here.

# Here, we choose an initial model that is not a great fit, and will fail utterly if no simulated annealing is used

fit lens alpha 4.5 1 0 0.5 120 0.7 0.2 shear=0.05 20 # Now we put our initial guess for the lens parameters
1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1                                    #vary flags; here we vary everything except for alpha and s (core size)

fit sourcept auto   # Here, we put our initial guess for where the source point is located (or 'auto' to let qlens attempt this).
						 # You can use 'fit plotimg' to see if the resulting images are roughly in the correct regions.
                   # If the fit doesn't converge even after simulated annealing, play around with qlens further and find a
						 # lens model and source point that fits the images more closely before trying again

# By default, the chi-square function is set to the source-plane chi-square (see B.4.6 of the Saas Fee Lectures by Kochanek (2004))
# This is usually best for a first-run fit; then we refine it by using the image plane chi-square function, which is slower
chisqflux on            # This means we use the image fluxes in the fit (very useful if you can use them)
time_delays off
chisq_time_delays off   # Don't use time delays (this is the default; time delays are only available for certain quasar lenses)
chisqtol 1e-6   # Sets the convergence criterion for finding the minimum chi-square. Bigger chisqtol --> less accuracy, but runs faster

simplex_temp0 = 1000000    # initial temperature should be chosen based on how much you expect the function (e.g. chi-square function)
                           #    to vary; when in doubt, start higher. If set to zero (the default), no simulated annealing is done
simplex_tempf = 10         # final temperature; after this is reached, a final minimization with zero temperature will be performed
simplex_nmax_anneal = 1000 # this is the number of iterations at each temperature setting (not including the final temp=0 run)
simplex_nmax = 10000       # this is the number of iterations for the final run, where the temperature will be set to zero
simplex_tfac = 0.97         # the temperature is multiplied by this factor after each run, continuing until final temperature is reached;
                           #    when in doubt, set closer to 1 for slower cooling
simplex_minchisq_anneal = 20      # optional, if specified the simplex will skip to zero temperature if the chi-square falls below this specified value

# For this example, I recommend that you play with simplex_temp0 to get a feel for how high a starting temperature is needed for success

nrepeat 2          # this tells it to minimize the chi-square again twice (at T=0) after converging to a best-fit point, just to ensure

             # zero-temperature run. This can be useful, e.g. if the chi-square is not converging well (or is converging very well!)
