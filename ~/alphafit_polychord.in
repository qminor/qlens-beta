# The correct lens model for the simulated data used here is as follows:
# alpha (b=5, alpha=1 s=0, q=0.7, theta=90, center=(0.9,0.3)
# external shear (gamma=0.1, theta=40 degrees)
# Source point: (0.5, 0.7)
#
# In this script we show how to infer these parameters by fitting a lens model
# to the simulated data using Polychord's version of nested sampling.

fit method polychord         # PolyChord nested sampling
sci_notation off        # This is just up to your personal preference
central_image off       # The image data does not include a central image, so this tells QLens not to search for one.

imgdata                      # Shows the image data so you can see what it looks like

# Here are some tips for deciding your initial guess for the lens parameters:
# Use the scale of the images to guess the Einstein radius.
# Always fix alpha=1 and s=0 (singular isothermal ellipsoid model). These parameters usually cannot be
#    constrained well unless we have time delays or multiple source points.
# The center of the lens can often be guessed at by averaging the image positions (or using the center of the
#    lens galaxy in the image if it is visible).
# It may only be possible to constrain both the external shear and axis ratio q if image fluxes or time delays
#    can be used in addition to the image positions. If you do model the external shear, guess a small
#    but nonzero value for both gamma and the angle, as we do here.
# Nested sampling requires lower and upper bounds as well, so pick a conservative but physically sensible
#    range for each parameter.

shear_components on # The parameter space is simpler to explore if we use the shear components, rather than shear magnitude and angle

# Once the nested sampling finishes, you can plot the resulting posterior probability distributions using the 'mkdist' tool,
# included with qlens, from the UNIX command line. For a quick start, you can go to the directory 'chains_alpha_poly' and type

# Alternatively, you can generate posteriors from qlens as follows. For the various plotting options, do "help fit mkposts"
