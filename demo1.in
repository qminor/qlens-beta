# Deleting current lens configuration, if any:

# We create our primary lens galaxy with an isothermal ellipsoid profile (axis ratio=0.7):
lens alpha 10 1 1 0.7 90

# Now we create a "source galaxy" which consists of an ellipsoidal grid of source points:
mksrcgal -1.4 -0.7 1 0.7 0 20 200
# Plot the grid so you can see what it looks like:

# Now we plot the images (this may take several seconds):
